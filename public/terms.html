  <h1>Terms / Liability</h1>

  <p>BrokerChain coordinates emergency response and urgent parts sourcing. We help match urgent demand (roof damage, flood pumps, generator trailer, HVAC outage, etc.) with providers or suppliers that can respond.</p>

  <p>We also support rapid public-sector and critical infrastructure requests that fall under a micro‑purchase threshold (typically up to around $15k USD). We help generate fast authorization (DocuSign) and a payment link (Stripe) so dispatch can be locked quickly, without a long procurement cycle.</p>

  <p class="small">We are Dispatch / Procurement Desk. We are not an insurance adjuster, licensed inspector, public adjuster, or engineering firm. We do not make coverage determinations for insurance, nor do we personally perform roof repair, HVAC repair, flood mitigation, or generator installation. We connect the requester with a provider or supplier and help lock in authorization, payment, and response timing.</p>

  <p class="small">For public-sector work: You confirm you are authorized to approve emergency spend under the applicable micro‑purchase limit before we dispatch. For private/commercial work: You agree to pay the dispatch / intake / emergency response fee via Stripe before crews roll.</p>

  <p class="small">Provider performance, workmanship, safety, compliance with local code/licensing, and insurance coverage remain the responsibility of the provider. BrokerChain can replace a provider if response fails, and can escalate issues, but is not liable for on-site work quality or delays caused by weather, access, permits, or unsafe conditions.</p>
